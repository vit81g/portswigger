# Web Security Academy 


PortSwigger is a web security company on a mission to enable the world to secure the web.
Security is no longer optional.

We rely on the web to connect those who need help with those that offer it. Unfortunately, too many business struggle to secure their software and risk losing the trust of their customers.

There's an outdated notion that securing your software is just a testing process that slows you down. But we see a new world, where security is an intrinsic part of all the products and services you deliver. Where web security simplifies the way you work and increases your agility.

That's why we created a company that goes beyond selling software to enabling companies to grow securely.
